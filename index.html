          <li><h2>Different Strokes</h2></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Freestyle/Front Crawl</strong> The front crawl is likely the
            first swimming stroke you think of when you picture swimming. It is
            commonly called the freestyle stroke as most swimmers choose to use
            this stroke in freestyle events as it is the fastest. To execute the
            front crawl, you lie on your stomach with your body parallel to the
            water. Propel yourself forward with alternating arm movements in a
            sort of windmill motion that starts by pushing underwater and
            recovers above water. Your legs should propel you with a flutter
            kick, which is performed with pointed feet as your legs move up and
            down in alternation. Do not bend your legs at the knee. Time your
            breathing to match your swimming strokes by turning your head to the
            side while your arm is in the recovery (above water) position. Do
            not turn your head too far and face upward or you will actually sink
            into the water rather than remain above it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backstroke</strong> The backstroke requires similar
            movements to the front crawl, but it is done, as the name suggests,
            on your back. Doctors often recommend this stroke to individuals
            with back problems as it provides a great back workout. To perform
            the backstroke, while floating on your back, alternate your arms
            with a windmill-like motion to propel yourself backwards. Like the
            front crawl, your arms should start the circular motion by pushing
            underwater and recovering above water. Your legs should engage in a
            flutter kick. Your face should be above the surface as you look
            straight up. Keep your body as straight as possible, with a slight
            decline in the lower body to keep your legs underwater. Don’t allow
            your hips to get too low or your body to bend too much or it will
            slow you down. Keep your legs close together and use the motion from
            your hips to get a more powerful kick. Your face will remain out of
            the water, but you will still want to be cognizant of your breathing
            rhythm. Again, match your breaths to your strokes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breaststroke</strong> The breaststroke is the slowest
            competitive swimming stroke, and it is the most commonly learned
            stroke. It’s often taught to beginner swimmers because it does not
            require putting your head underwater. However, in competitive
            swimming, swimmers do submerge their head and breathe at designated
            points in the stroke. This stroke is performed with your stomach
            facing down. Your arms move simultaneously beneath the surface of
            the water in a half circular movement in front of your body. Your
            legs perform the whip kick at the same time. The whip kick is
            executed by bringing your legs from straight behind you close to
            your body by bending both at your knees and at your hips. Your legs
            then move outward and off to the side before extending and coming
            back together. This swimming technique is often compared to a frog’s
            movement. Time each arm stroke to match your leg movements for more
            effective propulsion by resting the arms while the legs kick, and
            straightening the legs while the arms push you forward. This way,
            there is always something working to continue forward movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Butterfly</strong> The butterfly is an advanced swimming
            stroke that provides an excellent workout. It can be more difficult
            and tiring to learn, but it is also a lot of fun. It is the second
            fastest competitive stroke, and the favorite stroke of Olympic
            legend Michael Phelps. To perform the butterfly stroke, start
            horizontal with your stomach facing the bottom of the pool. Bring
            your arms simultaneously over your head and push them into the water
            to propel you forward and bring them up out of the water again to
            repeat. As you move your arms into the water, you will push your
            head and shoulders above the surface of the water. Your legs will
            perform a dolphin kick, which requires your legs to stay together
            and straight as you kick them similarly to how a dolphin’s lower
            body and tail moves. Move your body in a fluid wave-like motion. The
            best time to take a breath will be when your arms are just starting
            to come out of the water, just before you begin the next forward
            thrust. Lift your head straight in front of you during this move and
            do not turn your head to the side.
